Predicting Ecosystem Mapping 

This folder contains information needed to set up and run random forest models to predict ecosystem mapping in the Deception Area. 
You will need to structure your folders as per the word document detailed instructure (or adjust filepaths within the R code). 

You will need your own copy of base data (layer files) at the appropriate scales (25/10/5/1m) 

More changes will be made following the Vancouver meeting (November)
