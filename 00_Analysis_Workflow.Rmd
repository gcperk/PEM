##Overview 

The PEM analysis is broadly split into data preparation, pre-processsing, random forest analysis and output comparisons. 
This is currently completed using 5 scripts. 


### 1) Preparing spatial layers 

Create the required layers at a 25m, 10m, 5m scale. All analysis is to be conducted in BC Albers.


### 2) 00_Field_Data_prep.r 
- convert survey 123 outputs to a single table (rename column names, assign rankings to observers, etc) 
- Export as CSV


###3) 01_extract_pt_values_20181025.r
Part 1: 
- read in dataset from script 00 or if other changes completed to file (read in raw data file). 
- extract the point locations (Lat/Long) 
- create a stack of all raster (base layer variables) 
- for each data points drill through the stack of rasters and extract values 
- output the data in a csv file per scales of interest (i.e 5m, 20m, 25m)

Part 2: 
- read in the shapefile with BCG mapped. 
- intersect with point data to compare mapped BGC to field calls of BGC. 
- add TRUE/FALSE where field calls are different to the current mapped BGC layers
- export as 


###4) 02_Random_Forest.r
-  Read in the data file 
-  Clean data files (remove columns that are not required for analysis, remove data where there is no information on site series)
- Subset data for the model run. Theses include the following parameters 
(BCG, Forest vs Non-Forest, Dominent site series vs other sites series) 
- In addition the following parameters can also be tested: 
    - This includes: 
    + Crew () 
    + Experience (1,2,3),
    + Random.Point.ID, (number value or NA - highly skewed to NA)
    + Certainty (1,2,3,4) 
    + Transition (1,2,3,4,5,7,Null,Blanks)



###5) 03_ModelComparison.r


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
